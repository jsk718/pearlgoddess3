        <p><span class="name">Betty Sue King, the Pearl Goddess,</span> inaugurated King’s Ransom in 1979. After 14 years of classroom teaching she left the profession and created her wholesale business. Renowned for having pearls that extend the boundaries of opulence, she travels overseas several times a year to source her remarkable collection.</p>
        <p>A firm member, Betty Sue exhibits at the American Gem Trade Association Tucson GemFair™ and at the Society of North American Goldsmith Conferences. In past years she has exhibited at JCK Las Vegas, JA New York and MJSA. She served on the Board of Directors of AGTA for over nine years on the Membership, Executive and Promotion/Spectrum Committees.</p>
        <p>As a pearl specialist her industry and public education lectures are grounded by years of classroom teaching. Her presentations include AGTA Tucson GemFair Seminars, Antique Jewelry & Art Conferences, Los Angeles County Museum, WJA, GIA at Carlsbad and Alumni Associations, SNAG, NAJA, ISA, ASA, FIT and College of Marin. Retailers appreciating their need to be better informed, call on her to train their staff about the wonders of pearls.</p>

She has contributed updates on cultured pearl treatments to AGTA’s Gemstone and Enhancement Brochure and to CIBJO’s disclosure policies on pearls.
